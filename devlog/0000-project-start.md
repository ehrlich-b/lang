# 0000: Project Start

**Date**: 2024-12-25 (Merry Christmas, we're building a compiler)

## What happened

Bryan decided to write a programming language called "language" for a blog post. The audacity is strong.

Goals:
- Self-bootstrapping on x86-64
- C-like syntax to start
- "Extreme metaprogramming" (macros that can reshape syntax)
- GC'd eventually
- Fun over polish

## Current state

Brainstorming syntax options. The Go bootstrap compiler doesn't exist yet. We're in the "this is going to be so cool" phase before any actual work.

## Mood

Excited. The kind of excited where you haven't hit the first brick wall yet.

## Open questions

- What should the syntax actually look like?
- How much do we remember about x86 assembly? (not much)
- Will this actually become a blog post or just a mass folder on disk?
